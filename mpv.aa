# MPV 
- The idea for using mpv to seamlessly preview is to try use one of the tools that connects to a current mpv instance, and somehow integrates that into a 'tabbed' instance

## TOOLS:
- mpvc - connects to current instance
- umpv
- mpvctl
- mpvx: script grabbed from a comment in an issue thread on github


## OTHERS:
- RUST version of mpvc: https://gitlab.com/mpv-ipc/mpvc
- NCMPCC alike, mostly for audio it looks like https://gitlab.com/mpv-ipc/ncmpvc
